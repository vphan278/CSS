*{
    padding:0;
    margin: 0;;
}


The simplest CSS reset that web developers commonly use is to simply zero 
out the margin and padding for all visible elements on the page. This will
 make our designs consistent from one browser to another and allows us to 
 then specify padding and margin on only the elements where they will be 
 necessary.


 Also, it's important to validate your HTML/CSS often, as validating the 
 HTML/CSS gives insight on how you can fix issues that may lead to 
 cross-browser compatibility issues (and often, invalid HTML/CSS can lead 
 to weird behavior as the browser may not 'fix' invalid HTML/CSS quite the 
 right way).
